# Experience

I greatly enjoy collaborating on teams with other engineers, designers, engineering managers, and product managers. I enjoy the different perspectives such teams bring and the camaraderie that develops. Like a symphony orchestra, together we can achieve much greater things than any one of us could accomplish alone.

While a Software Engineer at PROS, I contributed to the frontend of browser-based B2B pricing and revenue software. I collaborated closely with designers, backend engineers, and product, and led feature development. I was an enthusiastic and active contributor to the PROS UI Community, including contributing to the internal component library, hosting and presenting at monthly PROS UI events, authoring articles for the internal PROS UI blog, and mentoring interns and new hires. In addition, I spearheaded a cross-team accessibility effort at PROS, which earned approval from technical leadership including the CTO and software architects. This effort included creating an 18-month timeline, leading a team of developers to assess 12+ accessibility testing tools, and regularly presenting knowledge sharing sessions on accessibility to the wider PROS UI community.

As a Senior Software Engineer at Mural, I contributed towards the collaborative whiteboard application. This was an exciting application as users could collaboratively and simultaneously interact with the digital whiteboard. I worked on various enhancements including new features such as tables, increasing the usability of widgets, and a major effort to modernize the application design. We used flags to iteratively test our changes during spikes to test out new user interactions and workflows within the app. One especially interesting challenge was to incorporate ChatGPT requests to provide recommendations to the user.

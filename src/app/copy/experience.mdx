# Experience

I greatly enjoy collaborating on teams with other engineers, designers, engineering managers, and product managers. I enjoy the different perspectives such teams bring and the camaraderie that develops. Like a symphony orchestra, together we can achieve much greater things than any one of us could accomplish alone.

As a fullstack Senior Software Engineer at Ghost, I collaborated with a fantastic team that was focused on building post-purchase workflows that improved efficiency for internal operations and enhanced the buyer and seller experience. Our features included a brand-new seller dashboard, on-platform payments, internal tools for our finance team, gathering seller logistics data, generating purchase orders (both rendered in the platform as a PDF and available for download), and email and subscription management. I also explored and applied agentic coding practices with Claude, Cline, and Cursor, contributing innovations that quickly implemented new product features and enhancements.

As a Senior Software Engineer at Mural, I contributed towards the collaborative whiteboard application. This was an exciting application as users could collaboratively and simultaneously interact with the digital whiteboard. I worked on various enhancements including new features such as tables, increasing the usability of widgets, and a major effort to modernize the application design. We used flags to iteratively test our changes during spikes to test out new user interactions and workflows within the app. One especially interesting challenge was to incorporate ChatGPT requests to provide recommendations to the user.

While a Software Engineer at PROS, I contributed to the frontend of browser-based B2B pricing and revenue software. I collaborated closely with designers, backend engineers, and product, and led feature development. I was an enthusiastic and active contributor to the PROS UI Community, including contributing to the internal component library, hosting and presenting at monthly PROS UI events, authoring articles for the internal PROS UI blog, and mentoring interns and new hires. In addition, I spearheaded a cross-team accessibility effort at PROS, which earned approval from technical leadership including the CTO and software architects. This effort included creating an 18-month timeline, leading a team of developers to assess 12+ accessibility testing tools, and regularly presenting knowledge sharing sessions on accessibility to the wider PROS UI community.

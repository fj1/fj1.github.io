# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world!

I am a frontend engineer with fullstack experience.

What do I love about frontend and engineering for the web?

## ðŸš€ Improving users' lives

It's very satisfying to improve and ease people's experiences as they navigate their lives online. If their experience can be delightful too, well, that's icing on the cake.

From the initial design, to building, testing, releasing, and iterations to make the product even better, the process of development is a rewarding journey and it's awesome to see the users benefit from these efforts.

## ðŸŒŽ Browsers are everywhere

When I first started coding, it was an incredible realization that I could build something and it was available to nearly everybody in the world.

In addition, browsers and frontend technologies are rapidly evolving. It's exciting to see how powerful browsers have become and to see the potential for amazing applications. The tech is enjoyable to learn and satisfying to create!

## ðŸ‘€ I get to see my work on the screen

...and that's just fun. ðŸŽ‰

# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world!

Fullstack engineer passionate about user-first design and using AI to move fast, learn with users, and ship delightful experiences.

What do I love about engineering for the web?

## ðŸš€ Improving users' lives

It's fulfilling to improve and ease people's experiences as they navigate their lives online. If their experience can be delightful too, well, that's icing on the cake.

From the initial design, to building, testing, releasing, and iterations to make the product even better, the process of development is a rewarding journey and it's awesome to see the users benefit from these efforts.

## ðŸŒŽ Building for Everyone, Everywhere

When I first started coding, it was an incredible realization that I could build something and it was available to nearly everybody in the world.

In addition, AI, frontend technologies, and browsers are rapidly evolving. It's exciting to quickly iterate to explore improvements and new features for our applications. The tech is enjoyable to learn and satisfying to create!

...and that's just fun. ðŸŽ‰

# Building this site

##### December 3, 2023

---

Building this site was a fun exercise in new-to-me technologies, especially Next.js and MDX.

Next.js is a React framework that includes server-side rendering. The documentation is fantastic, and I used Create Next App to quickly bootstrap the site. As a React developer, I found Next.js very easy and intuitive to use.

MDX extends Markdown to include JSX and modern JS features. I'm excited for this because as I continue to iterate on this blog, I'll be able to include React components. I'm looking forward to more vibrant blog posts as well as possibly some interactive demos!

Onwards! ðŸš€
